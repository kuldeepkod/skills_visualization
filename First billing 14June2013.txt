I have tried two slightly different visual representations.
"Conflict management" is the central skill! 
Now I would switch to the other visual representation.

The light blue circle is the central skill "conflict management". The dark blue circle are degree one connections. The orange circles are degree two connections.
I could not get the click and position change fucntionality yet and as that required effort to be invested, have written an email to you. Pls check - thanks!
I'd now show you the source code quickly.
These two index.html & index - copy.html are the files that produce the two visual versions.
The skills.json file has the json data for the skills and also the relation ship between skills.

That's all for today. Thanks!
